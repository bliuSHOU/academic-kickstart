Bin Liu was born in Hunan, China. He received the B.Sc. degree in information engineering and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in signal and information processing from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2007, 2009, and 2015, respectively. From 2012 to 2013, he was a Visiting Ph.D. Student with the Department of Signal, Image, and Data, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France, under the supervision of Prof. [Florence Tupin](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/tupin/). From 2015 to 2018, he was a Research Assistant Professor with the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Sensing and Recognition, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Since 2018, he has been a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the School of Marine Sciences, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai, in collaboration with Prof. X. Li (IEEE Fellow). His research interests include synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and polarimetric SAR image understanding and information mining, particularly spatial information analysis, segmentation and classification, multitemporal image analysis, target detection and recognition, and remote sensing data science for oceanography, particularly with machine learning / deep learning. He has published more than 10 peer-reviewed journal papers on these fields.
